## Documentation
### Loading System
You can use one of the three base providers to load scenes.
+ **LoadingEmptyProvider.** LoadingEmptyProvider is used to load the scene, without intermediate objects. This provider is used when you don't want to load additional elements such as scenes or prefabs. When using it, you immediately proceed to the loading of operations.
+ **LoadingScreenProvider** LoadingScreenProvider is used as an prefab while we wait for the next scene to load. This provider is used when you want to load an additional prefab before loading the next scene.

    + ðŸ“ƒLoadingScreenProvider is abstract. You must create a new class that inherits from it.
    + âš Injection in prefab happens after the Start method is called.
+ **LoadingSceneProvider.** LoadingSceneProvider is used as an intermediate scene while we wait for the next scene to load.  This provider is used when you want to load an additional scene before loading the next scene.
### UI System
